# Geopython-2024
Workshop for the Geopython 2024

## Abstract 
Earth Observation satellites offer a multitude of images daily. The workshop will cover the different steps of a remote sensing project using Python libraries.

## Description 
A remote sensing project includes several processes: search, filter and download available images from a certain area, but also visualize and analyze them to extract valuable information.

The use of Python libraries is very useful to successfully accomplish all this tasks. In that sense, the workshop will start with the development of Python scripts using libraries like earthaccess and landsatxplore in order to search and obtain images from the Landsat and Copernicus program APIs.

Once the images are obtained, it's usually necessary to visualize them on a plot. Different band combinations in true and false color can be performed, and Python libraries like earthpy and matplotlib can help in that task.

Finally, the last part of the workshop will introduce image analysis like band operations to calculate vegetation indices, but also image classification techniques to identify land coverages.

During the workshop, assistants will code the scripts in a jupyter notebook, but also we'll use Spyder, a very powerful environment for data scientists to write and run Python scripts.
